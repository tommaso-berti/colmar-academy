This simple website is used to train skills on responsive design.

## Wireframes
A wireframe is a document which contains the positioning of the elements on a page without specifying any other design information. This allows designers and developers to focus on the flow of a site without getting distracted with design decisions such as color and typography. These aspects of the design are important, but when they are introduced too early, they can detract from other important decisions.
